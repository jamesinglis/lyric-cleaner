# Lyric Cleaner

> Built on Vue.js

Lyric Cleaner is an in-browser solution for cleaning up lyrics from various sources, written with worship projection software in mind.

Lyric Cleaner is available online, hosted on [Heroku](https://lyric-cleaner.herokuapp.com) and also sometimes my [own domain](http://lyric-cleaner.jamesinglis.no/).
